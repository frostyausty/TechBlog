# TechBlog

## Description

This repo contains a CMS-style blog website. Users can create an account to login and start making their own blog posts. Users are able to view posts that other users have created and comment on them. As a user you are able to view the posts you've made in the dashboard tab. This application follows the MVC paradigm for the architectural structure. I used Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM and express-session npm package for authentication.
